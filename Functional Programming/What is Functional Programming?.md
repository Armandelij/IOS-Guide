# What is Functional Programming?

Functional Programming focuses on the usage of functions that contain sets of instructions. Basically The idea of functional programming consentrates
on computing results rather than performing actions. The significance a function written with a functional approach has is that when the function is
called it computes a value and returnes it instead of the programmer passing in step by instructions to get the desired results.

> Behind the scenes the function is using its own set of of instructions, which does use up CPU time and writing on to memory. HOWEVER from the
> perspective of the programmer, the effect is the return value
