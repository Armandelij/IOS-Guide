# How Core Data Works with Swift UI & Xcode 12

When we checked the the "use Core Data" box during the creation of our project, Xcode create an instance of the "PersistanceController" in our PizzaRestuarant swift file

We can find the PersistanaceController in the Persistance swift file along with all of its properties.

## Preview Property

The most important properties are the "preview" property which allows us to use the Core Data functionality inside the preview simulator. 
> Since we deleted the default entity "item" from our Core Data model we have to alter the property.

Replace the for in loop below:

with this this code 

``` swift
     for _ in 0..<10 {
            let newItem = Order(context: viewContext)
            newItem.status = "pending"
            newItem.id = UUID()
            newItem.tableNumber = "12"
            newItem.pizzaType = "Margherita"
            newItem.numberOfSlices = 4
        }

```



## Container Property

The heart of the PersistenceController is the container property. The container property can be seen as the swift army knife of Core Data because it acts as a in memory scratchpad where objects can be created, deleated, fetched, updated and saved back to the persistance store. 

Within the PersistenceControllers init function the container property gets assigned to the NSPersistenceContainer instance. The name argument should be set to the name of the datamodel.
