# Creating NSManagedObject Subclasses

When you create Core Data entitities and attributes related to those entities Core data will create somthing similar to a class. The attributes associated 
will resemble properties when you look at it. 

To have full control over the classes do the following:
1. Open the data model file and select the desired entity.
2. Open the right panel to show the data model inspector.
3. In the class section change the "Codgen" to Manual/None. This will allow us to fully control how our class is made.

Your screen should look like this.

To edit the subclasses do the following:
1. In the Editor menu choose create NSMAnagedObject Subclass. 
2. Make sure your project is selected and select Next, and make sure your entity is selected and
press Next. 
3. Now you will be asked where you would like to save this code, make sure you choose "Your project name" it should have a yellow folder on the left.
You can store this in the a folder as well. Then click create. 

Xcode has now created 2 files but we only are concerd with the one which is th CoreDataProperties.swift

Inside the file you will see someting simialr to this below. These are the attributes that you specified when defining your entity. 

``` swift
@NSManaged public var title: String?
@NSManaged public var director: String?
@NSManaged public var year: Int16

```

You can see in the code above that optionals are provided for two of the attributes and you may not want optionals. You do have the liberty to delete them,
however Core Data will still allow you to create instances of those values without providing a value. 

``` swift
@NSManaged public var title: String
@NSManaged public var director: String
@NSManaged public var year: Int16

```

However when we remove the (?)s from the attributes and follow through with the completion of the project errors are bound to occure. An easy solution is to 
create computed properties for each attribute and use the variable name of it to refere to the attribute in your code.

``` swift

public var wrappedTitle: String {
        title ?? "Unknown Title"
    }
    
    public var wrappedDirector: String {
        director ?? "Unknown director"
    }
