In this file we can set and manage the entities attributes that relate to one another in regards to the the project. You can think of entities as a class and atributes as properties of that class. 


> If you want to know more on entities and attributes check here. https://cocoacasts.com/what-are-core-data-entities-and-attributes#:~:text=You%20can%20think%20of%20attributes,bottom%20of%20the%20Attributes%20table.


Currently our file has a default "item" and attribute "if you do not see any default entity or attribute that is ok".
1. We need to delete the default entity by clicking on it and deleting it, do this for the attribute as well.
2. Create an entity by clicking on the "Add Entity" button at the bottom and name it "Order" 
3. Now we need to define the characteristics of an Order by providing it attributes. We can do this by pressing the "+" button.
  - create a "status" attribute  - this will keep track of the order status. this could be a Bool but it limits us in providing detailed information.
  - create an "id" attribute - this gives each order an unique id for identification.
  - create a "tableNUmber" attribute - this will provide us information of how many people are at a table.
  - create a "pizzaSlice" attribute - this will provide us information on the number of pizza slices.
  - create a "pizzaType" attribute - this will provide us information of the type of pizza.

Your data modle should look like this:
