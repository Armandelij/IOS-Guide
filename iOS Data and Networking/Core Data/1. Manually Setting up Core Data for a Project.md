# Manually Setting up Core Data for a Project

Create a project.. DO NOT check the core data option. Create the project


## Step 1
1. Act as if you were creating a new swift file but this time in the search bar type in "data model". Create a new data model.
2. Name the datamodel.

You data model file should look like this. Here we can define the entities and attributes of our data model. You can view the entities as a class and the attributes
as properties

 You can create an entity by pressing the add entity button at the bottom.
 You can create attributes by clicking the "+" button in the Attributes row.

> You can deleted entities and attributes by clicking them then pressing delete. 

## Step 2
1. Create a new swift file and name it DataController
2. In the file import the CoreData framework
3. Create a new class and name it DataController and have it conform to the ObservableObject Protocol.
  **- We can use @StateObject with it. The object will be created when the app launches and remain alive for as long as the apps run.**
4. Inside the DataController create an instance of NSPersistentContainer and set the name to the datamodel name we created in step 1.
  **- The NSPersistentContainer it is repsonsable for loading a model and giving us access to the data inside**
