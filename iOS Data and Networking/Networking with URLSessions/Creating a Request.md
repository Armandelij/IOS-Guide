# Creating a Request

1. We need to define the URL remote image 

``` swift
let url2 = URL(string: "https://bit.ly/2LMtByx")!

```

We create a URLRequest object by passing the URL object to the intializer and store the results in a VARIABLE named request. we will later modify this variable

``` swift

var request2 = URLRequest(url: url2)


```
