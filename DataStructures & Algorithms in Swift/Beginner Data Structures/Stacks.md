# Stacks

Stack data structures can be represented metaphorically like a stack of pancakes. Each pancack is laid one on top of the other and if you were to remove
them, you would have to remove them in the reverse order that you laid them down. This means the last pancake you placed one be the first one you take off. 

## Stack Operations 
The purpose in building a stack is to dictate how you access data.

**push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack
**pop:** Removing the top element of the stack. 

Stacks are knonw as (last in first out) LIFO data structures. Elements are that are pushed in last are the first to pop out.
