# Linked List 

A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear unidirectional sequence. 

Linked lists have some advantages over contigous storage options like arrays:
 - They have a constant insertion and removal from the front of the list. With arrays we achieve this from pushing and popping from the top or back of the
 array.

Linked List are responsible for two things:
- Hold a value 
- Hold a reference to the next node
> A nil value represents the end of a list.
