## Dynamic Arrays

# How do Dynamic Arrays Work
A dynamic array grows automatically when you try to add elements to an array that it a its capacity. 

APPROACH
When an array is full and yoiu want to add an element you will need to create a function. The function creates a new array that can be of a specific size
(bigger than the previous). The function would also copy the elements from the last array. You can reduce the size of the array, remove elements and add elements
from a postion in the array.
